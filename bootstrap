# Recommended development tools versions:
#   autoconf 2.52
#   automake 1.5
#   libtool 1.4.2
#
# NOTE:
#   There are a couple of known bugs in libtool that will be fixed with the
#   1.4.3 release. Meanwhile you have two options to address the problem:
#   - create these symlinks in the top dir:
#       ln -s acconfig/mkinstalldirs ./
#       ln -s configure.ac configure.in
#    OR
#   - apply to libtool 1.4.2.
#     It is avaliable here:
#     http://www.techmonkeys.org/~tothwolf/libtool/libtool-1.4.2-auxdir.patch
#
# Please note that it may happen that the bootstrap process reports errors.
# This doesn't necessarily mean that something went wrong. Try if ./configure
# and make run without any unexpected errors before reporting bugs. And of
# course make sure you have the tool's versions above installed before
# bootstrapping the package. If you don't have them, you can alternatively
# download the prepackaged and already bootstrapped current CVS snapshot (
# daily resynched) at:
# ftp://ftp.eggheads.org/pub/eggdrop/source/snapshot/eggdrop1.7-snapshot.tar.gz
