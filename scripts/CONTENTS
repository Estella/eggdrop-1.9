These are the example scripts that come with eggdrop.  They're meant
to be useful AND to introduce Tcl to those who haven't dealt with it
before.  Even people who program in Tcl may be confused by eggdrop's
implementation at first, because so many commands were added to
interface the bot.

action.fix.tcl
   gets rid of those ugly /me's people do instead of a .me.

alltools.tcl
   toolbox.tcl, toolkit.tcl, moretools.tcl and a few more tools all in 1 file
   toolbox.tcl
      cmwagner's collection of handy procs
   toolkit.tcl
      a few useful procs that may be required by other Tcl scripts
   moretools.tcl
      more useful procs from David Sesno

   tcl script used to crontab your Eggdrop
   usage: ./autobotchk <eggdrop config file>

botchk
   A shell script which can be used for auto-starting the bot via 'cron'.

cmd_resolve.tcl
   adds a dcc command called '.resolve' which can be used to resolve hostnames
   or ip addresses in the partyline.

compat.tcl
   maps old tcl functions to new ones, for lazy people who can't be bothered
   updating their scripts

   same channel)
