Eggdrop Scripting Commands
Last revised: March 01, 2003
     _________________________________________________________________

This is an exhaustive list of all of the scripting commands added to Eggdrop.
All of the normal built-in commands specific to the scripting module you are
using are still there, of course, but you can also use these to manipulate
features of the bot. They are listed according to category. This list is
accurate for Eggdrop v1.7.0.
