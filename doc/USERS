                              Users and Flags

    People on IRC are recognized by the bot according to their nick!user@host.
    That is, if I am on IRC as:

       *** Robey is robey@hubcap.clemson.edu (i hate milk)

    Eggdrop will identify me according to "Robey!robey@hubcap.clemson.edu" and
    not only by my nickname.

    Eggdrop does not use access levels like some bots. Instead, each user has
    "flags" that entitle them to certain privileges. A flag can be thought of
    as a badge. Any user can have any number of flags -- you can have no flags,
    or you can have all of them. Some flags are good, some are bad. Each flag
    is identified by a letter. A channel flag applies only to a specific
    channel, and a global flag applies to all channels. The standard global
    flags are:

      a  (auto-op)        user is opped automatically upon joining a channel.
      b  (bot)            user is a bot.
      e  (nethack-exempt) user is exempted from stopnethack protection.
      f  (friend)         user is not punished for flooding, etc.
      g  (auto-voice)     user is voiced automatically upon joining a channel.
      j  (janitor)        user can perform maintenance in the file area of the
                          bot (if it exists) -- like a "master" of the file
                          area. Janitors have complete access to the filesystem.
      m  (master)         user has access to almost every feature of the bot.
      n  (owner)          user has absolute control. Only give this flag to
                          people you trust completely.
      o  (op)             user has op access to all of the bot's channels.
      p  (party)          user has access to the partyline.
      t  (botnet-master)  user has access to all features dealing with the
                          botnet.
      v  (voice)          user gets +v automatically on +autovoice channels.
      w  (wasop-test)     user needs wasop test for +stopnethack procedure.
      x  (xfer)           user has access to the file transfer area of the bot
                          (if it exists) and can send and receive files to/from
                          the bot.

    All global flags other then b, x, j, and p are also channel-specific flags.
    Flags are set with the chattr command. The syntax for this command is:

      chattr <nickname> [attributes] [channel]

    There are also 26 global user-defined flags and 26 channel user-defined
    flags. These are used by scripts, and their uses very depending on the
    script that uses them.
